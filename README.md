# V2V-Comm Spring 2019

The UAVs@Berkeley Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication project leverages distributed networking techniques to allow a small team of multirotors to cooperatively build a structure out of foam blocks.

The project is built on ROS and rosflight. We're currently implementing autonomous indoor flight capability using fiducial markers in the environment for global position estimation.

All the software and hardware documentation, including installation instructions for your machine and for a raspberry pi are available in the [wiki](<https://github.com/UAVs-at-Berkeley/v2v-comm-v2/wiki>).
